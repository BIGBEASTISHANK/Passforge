# Passforge: A Rust-based Password Manager

Passforge is a secure password manager built with Rust, designed to help you store, manage, and generate passwords with robust encryption. It uses offline file storage to ensure your data stays safe and under your control. The command-line interface (CLI) is fully developed, and a graphical user interface (GUI) is currently in progress.

## Key Features:
- **Secure Offline Storage**: Your passwords are saved in locally encrypted files, so your data never leaves your device, providing an extra layer of privacy and security.
- **Strong Encryption**: All passwords and sensitive data are encrypted using industry-standard algorithms to ensure your information is safe from unauthorized access.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The CLI is fully functional and provides a simple and effective way to manage your passwords directly from the terminal. You can add, retrieve, generate, and manage your passwords through intuitive commands.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The GUI is under development, and will provide a more user-friendly experience for those who prefer a visual interface over the command line.
<!-- - **Cross-Platform**: Passforge is built with portability in mind, aiming to work seamlessly across various platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows. -->
- **Password Generation**: Easily generate strong, random passwords with customizable options for length and complexity.
